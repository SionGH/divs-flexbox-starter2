                <p>I am a <span>Responsive Designer & Developer</span> who thrives on visual storytelling. When I'm not working, pursuing side projects or getting lost in the rabbit hole of blogs & books, I can be found traveling, hiking and searching for new stories.</p>

                <p>I was born and raised in the Canary Islands, lucky enough to have a beach in my city. At twenty-something, I went to London, fell in love with the place and lived there until my thirties. There wasn't a beach but many parks and a river.</p>

                <p>In my forties, I fell in love and went to live in South Africa.
                    There there were many beaches and beautiful nature all around.
                    Life wasn't easy there, so I returned to my sunny island again.
                    Here I've been since then.</p>

            <div class="div-3">
                <p>Today I'm changing careers. Here I'm learning how to flexbox. I have to recognize that becoming a front-end developer isn't easy at all, but it is very interesting and gratifying. I started by becoming a UX/UI designer and went a step further. I'm happy I made this choice.</p>
